### Facts about Village: (Name: Basht)

* Near Eastern tip of Dragonspine Mountains
    * Village has a small limestone quarry at the base of the mountain (limestone is sedimentary, and commonly found in ancient runoff zones)
        * Quarry can hold evidence of older civilizations, remains of ancient creatures, etc 
        * Quarry is human-run, not a dwarven operation. That said, there’s no reason that a dwarf or three can’t be involved… 
        * Village has always coexisted with the Fae presence, outsiders have not yet learned the proper offerings to the mountain fae to avoid harassment
* Mouth of River Stojanow
    * Ample farming and natural resources
    * River is main source of travel to and from the village
* Annual festival involving goats? 
    * Every year they appoint a new goat as “mayor” and he is given a place of honor and well cared for in the middle of town, on the first day of spring, the old goat is led into the forest and left as an offering to the Fae.
    * “Every year, we offer you our mayor in exchange for our safety”
    * Fae have been (so far) amused
    * See background plot for more info
* Census & population:
    * Approximate # of residents: 80
    * 50 in village limits
    * 30 in outlying farms and surrounding area
    * Approximately 40 humans, 12 halfling farmers, 8 elves (Children of Mourning; in a square stone complex about 3 miles away & up the mountain), 6 dragonborn (Glitterscales), and the rest from the other PHB races
* Filled with many superstitions
    * The pact with the Fae does not apply to them, yet they have many rituals to avoid angering the fae regardless
    * Fae are never actually called the “fay” but “Our Good Neighbors” or similar
    * Worries about children being stolen, occasionally children named to “fool” the fey
    * Everyone has to knock twice to enter, once could be the fey, but never three times, as that is a bad omen
* The village is insular and secure; they do not seek outside influence for most issues
    * What attracts adventurers to this place?
    * What keeps adventurers in this area without “wrecking the joint”?
    * Non-adventurers were always hesitant to approach the place, given its location surrounded by this small part of the Quivering Forest and the possibility it might break the pact.
    * Now that the pact is broken, that might no longer be an obstacle to new people
* No inn/ tavern/ highway house
    * No real visitors due to superstitions about the fae
    * No inn in order to avoid a visit from the “Mysterious Stranger,” only private homes where individuals need to be invited in each night.
    * Villagers congregate in gazebos and central square
    * Meetings of the village elders happen in a small room in the bakery
    * [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJTjqOoUsAA1SdY.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJTjqOoUsAA1SdY.jpg)
* Quivering forest on other side of the river
    * There is a small amount of the trees on this side of the river, not covered by pact
    * Displaced fey are starting to expand across the river into this “part of the Quivering Forest”


### Key NPCs

* Village elders: “Shepherds”
    * Have irregular meetings in a room in the bakery
        * Bakery has a lot more space than you would expect, but they take great pains to set up and then stow any furniture being used for the meetings

        * Lives in a small “mother-in-law” attachment to the local bakery
        * Much more cautious since he’s died, trying to hold onto the past
        * Despite her caution, very keen intellect and good judge of character, with a few idiosyncrasies
        * Newcomers in town seem like a bad sign to her, too much change at once
        * Most other members defer to her
        * Distrusts the Khahans, both because of their heritage and because Yuhul is openly opposing much of the traditions that she holds to.

        * Respects and loves his mother, and attempts to sway her opinion gently
* Village busybody
    * I would imagine several, given that the town is ruled by elders

        * Lives with Lavinia “Gran”, his grandmother, but he looks more like his grandfather 
        * Varda has been “rooted” in that it demonstrates Yul’s dedication to Gond. Has become a permanent building, with a small foundry space on one side (bellows, smokestack, etc)
        * Yul’s newest invention is a water-based drill, plot of an adventure, so yes!
    * Lavinia “Gran” Khahan - Vistani, brought through the mists by her adventurer husband
        * Living with and worried about Yul, does not approve of his inventions, but supportive of her last living relative
        * Wrinkled skin with many smile lines, long grey hair with elegant braids, bright sparkling brown eyes, effusively friendly to any that take the time to listen to her, tremendous gossip, meets with other elder women of the village, but is not considered an elder herself. (partially out of her own choice, partially not.)
        * Husband an adventurer, died many years ago, does not wish her grandson to go that route

### Background plot

* Blood lord (myth & legend)
    * CCC-UCON-01 (gnolls, references to Mists of Ravenloft)
        * This village is the location of the stone used for the standing stones
    * CCC-LINKS-02 (themes: fey plots, hard choices)
    * The Blood Lord is NOT “mapped out” or defined; could simply reference a boogeyman legend from the area or could be stories of Strahd, brought back to Faerun by the Vistani/Gur.
* Mysterious Stranger (legend)
    * Shape changing visitor who speaks on behalf of the fey
    * Will not enter a house that he has not been invited into
    * Keeps his word, but twists it as much as possible to his or his patrons benefit
    * Note to self: Look into Mark Twain story “Mysterious Stranger,” seems very applicable.  “Number 44” is name for similar character. Maybe lift quote from it.
* Limestone is a very valuable building product, and with the recent events around the Moonsea it could be in high demand
    * This easily attracts the attention of the Zhents and the Lords’ Alliance, and thereby also the attention of the Harpers. 
    * Strange customs and history are important to the Harpers, as it leads to a greater understanding of the fey
    * Limestone commonly holds fossils and other historical records (Emerald Enclave)
    * Trade could be monitored by Order of the Gauntlet
* Goat Mayors involved in sacrifice are taken by boat across the river (no hay or wolves are taken in said boat, because that puzzle is beyond most people)
    * Originally male children were the sacrifice, they were taken and manacled just inside the forest, near a large mysterious monolith with runes dedicated to ???? (the blood lord perhaps?)
    * Former mayor bargained with the Mysterious Stranger, creating the tradition of a goat mayor being offered to the fey.
    * Fey accept this mostly out of amusement.

This a rough idea of where it would go.  (We do not have permission to use this map, so we’ll need to work with someone to get a better map, but this is one of the few that I’ve seen that have the Quivering forest, Dragonspine Mountains, and Phlan on it.)
