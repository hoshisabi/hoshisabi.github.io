Did not need to buy a ticket, they had tickets for each of us

Got sycamore seed that will give a +1d4 to a an ability check later

Gave a button to a monkey with the calliope

Found a young boy, and then Talked to Dirlagun about her lost cub, gave us a mirrored ball to see if we could find her

Went to carousel and found sayings on them, painted missing names, got telepathic hints for later:

Bavlorna Blightshaw has some items, allergic to running widdershins
Skabitha, lives in a dollhouse, can't remember teh first creature she sees every day
In possession of Endolin Moongrave, who lives in a mountain top theater, told hag has forseen her own death that only happens during an eclipse. (my item)
Everyone competed in games of skill

Went to bubble teapot (and got a packet of scatterleaf tea)

Competed for poetry, failed utterly

Played the ring toss to regain ego, failed still -- replayed until won a spider and wine, traded wine for face paint

Tried tail of the dragon, got another spider, traded for wine

went to see mermaid and then she got heckled, where she fled
her beloved's voice was stolen
she'll return if we recover the voice.

investigation turns up that the person who lost the voice is candlefoot the mime

talked to candlefoot, mime, mimed that his voice was stolen by a troublemaking kenku

did snail racing, game in fourth, acesis came in first

visited some more rides, found kenku, talked
patron is same as patron of the carnival
making trouble to get attention, trying to find patron

returned watch to mr. witch, agreed to find patron and part of that will be sending us to where our lost things are
gave advice, "mind the rule of three, past present and future, find the alicorn and free the dormant queen at last"
went through mirror "hither thither here and there, wander yonder show me where"
mirror also showed us aging from youth to death

Went through the portal, ended up on a highway, climbed down a long ladder with footholds
ended up in a swampy region, saw in the distance a hot air balloon start to come down in the distance

----

Tracked the balloon down, it had come down on the side of a tower.

Tower surrounded by brambles, person in tower asked for help said pilot had died, but they were stuck

Snuck around tower, but door was behind two giant snakes

Tried talking to snakes, not sentient, fought them

Climbed tower to retrieve person, turned out it was a faerie dragon

Sir Talavar locked in a gilded, enchanted cage, could not pick the lock
suggests that we look for a collector of keys in the swamp

Met up with mud mephits, who demanded to know what their favorite food was.

Argued legalese with them to get out of it, but they still wanted to know

We didn't know the answer, but answer was mud pie.
progressed further, talked to some animated trees, who wanted us to turn back they didn't want trouble
convinced them we didn't mean any trouble

Talked to Goblin covered with keys, who said that she had the keys
she's been having problems with harengon brigands
got a silver key from her
suggested we avoid the brigand leader

Trees on the way out gave us an iron key

Later found a geyser with trinkets on top, floating orbs around the geyser
orbs own the trinkets
water from geysers controls the rise and fall of the waters in area
hags somehow involved
pointed us further in direction of brigands

Brigand captain attacked us, knocked Sheema unconscious and captured them
fighting on causeways

when he hit us it did fire damage and made us blind to him
acesis also knocked unconscious but we could pull him from combat off causeway
tried to sneak around and tossed a torch into a skiff
ended session there.

through combination of stealth, magic facepaint, and pixie dust we snuck into the village of the brigands
we were caught after we found our friends, we found the satyr wizard with them
agdon made a deal, as we were caught, made a deal for our safety an no longer harassing jingle jangle
in exchange we will free the person captured by the hags and put in a good word for him
fae bargain
went to downfall past the bullwugs and they suggested we talk to the nobles
walked across boulders, one of htem took offense, "Flint", so Martauq sang an apology to him and we crossed
Found a building being set o nfire by animated coals, we helped the bullywug noble who was fighting them and he gave us a medal to help with talking to the king
Then ran into Clapperclaw, a strange creature with lobster claws and a gourd head, who asked us to help him find his original head which was being held by Bavlorna, he joined us
Then talked to the king, told him that we were looking for Bavlorna and could help him he was reading Bavlorna's Big Book of Blood
Took us to get attired in courtly garb (swamp stained, etc)

Went to the pool which had been polluted
samuel found a gel cube inside
fought and killed it, sheema went unconscious
Went to get Book of Bad Blood from Bullywug king
offered exchange, but he just wanted to not be in the book
tell Bavlorna that he gave it back to her
Have to get crate of carcasses
asked the balloon factory duke, who suggested the hunter
found a hut with a frog that wanted to "play" which swallowed me whole
Found an abandoned hut near some giant toadstools (not the hunter's lodge)
found the hunters, talking about things in bullywug, wanted the note to enter
We exchanged the bottle for the items on the crate and got the crate to return to Bavlorna
Turned in the hunters and baron to the king, got item in exchange
Went to a merchant, got a monocle of moonlight in exchange for helping king
Went to Bavlorna's with the crate, the book, and the cleared pool
She needed to take a bath before dealing with us again
We explored while we waited
Found a redcap fighting vultures for meat, helped him by capturing vulture
Bloody Toes is her name, she hates Bavlorna because she is compelled to not attack
Rescued Satyr, Vancil
Found campestri in a jar
Found a chest with cold coming from it, we left that alone
Found a door with buzzing, we left it alone
Found a moonshine distillery
Found a table with lots of plates on it and flies
Went and found a mirror that changed our expressions
Found a lot of portraits with sour expressions
Bavlorna returned
Made a deal that we would find her sister's portrait for her in Thither
We have 8 days to return it for a Fay bargain
Acesis got a stick of good luck from Vancil in exchange for rescuing him
Let the campestri free
Returned head to Clapperclaw, who agreed to lead us to thither
talked to Bavlorna about returning our guide's skull as a form of payment to him, so that's where we got his missing head

moved to the next realm, came upon a cave and a tree with parchment nailed to the tree, parchment was a wanted poster for "sorry wretch" and reward was ten years of your youth
went to the cave, saw man spinning gold while blindfolded, he directed us towards granny nightshade
Met a campestri dipping his cap into a pan of boiling butter, waiting for his friend so that he would have dinner together (Carpenter and Walrus?)
goblin returned, explained that there was a candy merchant in loomlurch
acesis made food + water to bargain with goblin to not eat campestri
took a long rest by the campfire of the goblin
we travelled further, as we got closer to a lake, we found that the path would prevent us from moving closer
found another poster: "This rapscallion vexes me. Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I’ll curse one creature whom you name.”
Encountered a dryad and animated shrubs
they attacked, we fought, talked her into not continuing
she thought we were mercenaries from hag for toyshop, or to catch will
she provided 3 sycamore seeds that if they are eaten will be a pass without trace
Made our way to Loomlurch
Went to the goblin candy merchant
Talked to Skabitha, she did not want to give up the painting, but agreed to let us see them if we retrived a unicorn horn
Would give the three inches that she took from Kizz if we get something for her from her sister
Went inside the painting at night, we were discoveredby Sowpig, lied and said that we were getting the paintings to get cleaned
Got my finger pricked by a thorn, painting looked like me and my relatives.
Cut a piece of thorn, grabbed other paintings
Idea is that Bavlorna can prick her finger and one of them will be Skabitha
Returned paintings to Bavlorna
She was happy, but she said her sister will be furious
She had me prick my finger to test the magic
She then pricked her finger and it worked as expected

Recap after long absence

Acesis Talked to Bloodytoes to see if she worked with poultices
found out that the cauldron might be near the lakeshore

Walked around the lakeside

First place found insulting pixies, ignored them

Walked near the place where we found conspiratorial bullywugs, walked along the shore past

Found cauldron with animated coals with fire beneath

Tried to pry the lid off of the cauldron, but the cauldron scuttled away

Magmin beneath, spoke ignan, comprehened languages revealed was looking for dry wood in exhange

We had traded for dry firewood in the past, gave it to magmin who kicked the horn out of the coals for us

Magmin told us the password to get into the cauldron ""

Opened the cauldron and bottled a vial of the contents

Returned to Bavlorna's cottage to clean paintings so that we could clean the paintings

In exchange for doing housekeeping in the dining room (And being nauseated by the rotting food)

Now when we return to Skabitha, we can say we delivered the paintings to be cleaned

returned to Skabitha

explained that we did clean paintings and since they were family paintings, they're with her sister

She was very upset, to calm her down we talked about the unicorn horn
when we return the horn, she gave a pole of collapsing in exchange for the horn and kizz got his 3" of height

explored to try and find Will

ran across a blink dog funeral

Kizz case comprehened languages, they could understand sylvan but spoke blinkdog
Acesis held a funeral for them
they told us about scarecrows for granny nightshade (Skabitha), that would warn her

Ran across another circle of dancing campestris

Ran across a large treant and some children

Will was one of the children wanted to know if we were with the hag

Explained that we were looking for lost items and needed help getting to Yon

Found Star, the displacer beast kitten

In exchange for helping him free children, he would return Star back to her mother

Lamorna is the unicorn, go to the lake dressed as a unicorn to be able to approach, drop coals to summon Lamorna

Squirt, animated oilcan, granny made him, needs boggle oil

Travelled along the river towards the lake

Could not stealth past the ward

Got down on hands and knees and draped a cloak over my back and put a stick on my forehead to "masquerade" as a unicorn

Will's plan is that we distract skabitha
Will's group will cause a distraction that will free us to free the kids
We return the kids to the unicorn

Lit coals, unicorn appeared, crossed lake to talk to her
She agreed to guard the kids and help any that were hurt

While talking to the unicorn we were attacked by half-orc Zarak
Managed to defeat him, he agreed to not attack unicorn anymore as a pact
He told us about his adventuring party, scocerer kelek and warduke etc

Distracted Skabitha until Will could move into place

Told her that Kelek and Zarak were coming to steal power

Told them that they had intended to take Zybilna's place

Once Will started, we moved in
