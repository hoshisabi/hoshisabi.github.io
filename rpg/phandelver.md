This will be where I can put information about the Phandelver campaign.

Current rules:
* Characters stats are assigned either using the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or [point buy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#VariantCustomizingAbilityScores)
* Characters starting equipment is from the starting equipment from their class and background
* Characters will be a non-evil alignment
* Valid books to use are the Forgotten Realms Books (minus Acquisitions Inc)
* If your background is one that does not give a feat, you can pick a feat from [Skilled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/44-skilled), 
  [Tough](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/49-tough), or [Magic Initiate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/31-magic-initiate).
* Even if we use AL rules, we will voluntarily not play these characters in other games until we finish.

Questions:
* Do we want to run using Adventurers League rules?
* What characters/players will we have?
