# Happy Liars Night, All!
Liars Night celebrates the change of seasons when nothing is as it once was. Some settlements increase activity to prepare for the sun's hibernation and find any excuse for merriment before the cold chases everyone indoors. Where the seasons become warmer, settlements celebrate the growth of once-dormant life.

No one is as they seem on Liars Night, or less so than usual. Children and adults alike disguise themselves with illusion and costume. Tricksters, pranksters, and performers play for genuine laughs. People wear boldly decorated coin purses filled with treats, specifically for practiced and amateur pickpockets to pilfer. Candlelit carved pumpkins and gourds indicate that no one will hold your deceptions and chagrins against you. That does not mean that mean-spirited mischief, abuse, and disrespect are excused. Colleagues, family, friends, and neighbors continue following social contracts (and real life codes of conduct), cooperating and acting respectfully. Mean-spirited actions, even as minor as blowing out others' candles and smashing decorated gourds, are judged poorly by the community. Leira, the deity of illusion and deception, and Mask, the trickster patron of spies and thieves, do not favor those who disrupt their holiday.

## Holiday Special Events
Since 2018, Adventurers League has offered one-of-a-kind holiday events for a limited time. They've included Wandering Monster encounters, familiars, trinkets, and magic items. This year's celebration is transformative.

## Liars Night Lycanthrope
You've been bitten by the Liars Night "bug," a cranium rat named The Kernel (also known as the Candy King and Sugar Fiend). Now, your character has a temporary lycanthropy.

**_Duration_**:
The following effects last from October 9th to January 7th, 2024. On January 8th, the lycanthropy wears off.

_**Shifting Into Your Lycanthropic Form**_:
Once per session, as a bonus action, you can assume your lycanthropic appearance. This transformation lasts 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action.

_**Spreading Lycanthropy**_:
This lycanthropy can only be passed on by The Kernel, not by your attacks.

_**Character Changes**_:
A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains their statistics except as specified below.

* _**Alignment**_: This lycanthropy does not change your alignment. The only possible change is your mood and actions, as you may feel more cheer for Liars Night or have a deep interest in preparing for the upcoming seasons.
* _**Damage Resistance**_: In or out of were-form, you have damage resistance to nonmagical attacks made by cranium rats.
* _**Temporary Hitpoints**_: Each time you shift into your lycanthropic form, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 × your proficiency bonus.
* _**Proficiencies**_: In were-form, you are proficient in your lycanthrope's natural attacks.
* _**Languages**_: In were-form, your character can speak, read, and write as usual but may have minor changes to pitch, depending on the transformation you choose.
* _**Choose One**_: The Kernel's bite transforms you into one type of lycanthrope. Choose one from the options below. Rebuild rules can apply to this transformation while respecting the table and honor system.
