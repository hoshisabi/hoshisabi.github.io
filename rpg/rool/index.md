This is all placeholder information until I have time to type more.

Rool is loosely based on the brownies from the movie Willow.

Rool has gone on an adventure before, he rescued a lost infant child along with another member of his
group of faeries. Despite the fact that others thought of him as a hero, he felt no sense of accomplishment
from that task. He's now looking for bigger things to do, so that he can prove himself to be worth the 
praise that he received from his group.

But so far, nothing he's tried has given him that.

That may change now that he's been introduced to actual adventurers.
