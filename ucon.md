# U-Con Gaming Convention
![](media/gather_for_ucon.png)

## We are coming together to play in person again!

If you have volunteered to be a DM already, I'll be keeping track of things here. There is still time to get 
your events listed, so if you're still interested please sign up with the form below. You can, of course, 
also volunteer with U-Con directly if you'd like to run something not AL related or even not D&D Related! :)

[Volunteer to DM for Adventurers League](https://forms.gle/H1M2TM6JHH1oG4c38)  (event submission open until September 15th)
